      <p>Hello! ðŸ‘‹</p>
      <p>
        My name is Sivert, and I&apos;ve been a coding enthusiast ever since I was a
        kid.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started experimenting with coding at a young age, and have been hooked
        ever since. I now have about 7 years of coding experience, and have been
        working professionally with full-stack development for about 1.5 years.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I&apos;m not at work, I love spending my time working on my own game
        development projects. I&apos;m a big fan of the game engines Unity, Unreal
        Engine and Roblox, and have recently gained a small following on
        Twitter, where I share insights to my latest projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recently, I&apos;ve been exploring AI technology and have been working with a
        friend, Ola Hulleberg, to train a model that recognizes specific
        creatures in a video game. We plan to use the model to create an
        automated &quot;shiny-catcher&quot; that will both train our own creatures and
        capture any rare creatures it encounters. It&apos;s been an exciting project
        and I can&apos;t wait to see where it takes us.
      </p>

      <p>
        All in all, I&apos;m a passionate developer with a wide range of interests.
        I&apos;m committed to quality in everything I do, and I can&apos;t wait to see
        where my career takes me.

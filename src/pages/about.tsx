      <h2>Hello! ðŸ‘‹</h2>
<p><b>My name is Sivert, and coding has been my passion since childhood.</b> I started experimenting with coding at a young age, and I&apos;ve been hooked ever since. With approximately 7 years of coding experience, I have developed a solid competence.</p>
<p><b>Over the past 2 years, I have worked as a full-stack developer in professional teams.</b> This experience has provided valuable insights into working efficiently and collaborating seamlessly with others.</p>
<p><b>During my free time, I indulge in game development.</b> I am a big fan of game engines like Unity, Unreal Engine, and Roblox, and I have been working with them since around 2015. It is a passion that brings me immense joy and fulfillment.</p>
<p><b>Recently, I had the opportunity to explore AI technology with <a target='_blank' href='https://hulleberg.net'>Ola Hulleberg</a>.</b> We have been training a recognition model capable of identifying creatures in a video game. The goal is to enable the model to analyze screenshots from the game and make context-based decisions. This exciting project has opened up new horizons for me, and I eagerly anticipate the possibilities it holds.</p>
<p><b>All in all, I am a dedicated developer with a wide range of interests. Quality is of utmost importance to me in everything I undertake, and I eagerly await the opportunities my career has in store.</b></p>
